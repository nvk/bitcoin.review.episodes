## Bitcoin.Review Podcast Episode 03 - We continue 

I Scratched my own itch with Episode 01, so this will keep going as my best efforts place to talk about Bitcoin Project software updates and some other commentary that I find interesting or noteworthy to me. I also would like to invite you to send Bitcoin related questions, just go to bitcoin.review and click submit story at the top right.

This week for Episode 3, our guests [Justin Moon](https://twitter.com/_JustinMoon_) and [Matt Odell](https://twitter.com/ODELL) return to help me read the list.

I should mention the overwhelming feedback is that we have failed at being boring,  so we should try to do better.

- COLDCARD Mk4 5.0.5 - July 20, 2022
   - Enhancement: BIP-85 derived passwords. Pick an index number, and COLDCARD will derive a deterministic, strong (136 bit) password for you. It will even type the password by emulating a USB keyboard. See new areas: Settings > Keyboard EMU and Settings > Derive Seed B85 > Passwords.
   - Documentation: added docs/bip85-passwords.md documenting new BIP-85 passwords and keyboard emulation.
   - Enhancement: BIP-85 derived values can now be exported via NFC, in addition to QR code.
   - Enhancement: Allow signing transaction where foreign UTXO(s) are missing. Only applies to cases where partial signatures are being created. Thanks to [@straylight-orbit](https://github.com/straylight-orbit)
   - Enhancement: QR Codes are now easier to scan in bright light. Thanks to [@russeree](https://github.com/russeree) for this useful fix!
   - Bugfix: order of multisig wallet registration does NOT matter.
   - Enhancement: Support import of multisig wallet from descriptor (only sortedmulti, BIP-67). Also support export of multsig wallet as descriptor.
   - Enhancement: Address explorer can show "change" addresses for standard derivation paths for both single and multisig wallet.
   - New tutorial: 2of2 multisig with 2x Coldcard signing device, and bitcoin-qt as coordinator, see docs/bitcoin-core2of2desc.md

- Bitcoin Core updates (unreleased)
    - h/t Optech; [Bitcoin Core #24148](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24148) adds watch-only support for [output script descriptors](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/output-script-descriptors/) written in [miniscript](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/miniscript/). For example, a user can import wsh(and_v(v:pk(key_A),pk(key_B))) to begin watching for any bitcoins received to the P2WSH output corresponding to that script. A future PR is expected to add support for signing for miniscript-based descriptors.
    - h/t Optech;  [Bitcoin Core GUI #471](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/471) updates the GUI with the ability to restore from a wallet backup. Restoring was previously only possible either using the CLI or by copying files into particular directories.
